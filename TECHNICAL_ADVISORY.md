# Spectra AI — Technical Advisory

This document records the implementation challenges encountered during development, the root-cause analysis for each, and the solutions applied. It serves as an engineering reference for understanding non-obvious design choices in the codebase.

## 1. LangGraph Checkpointing Inside a Lambda Cold Start

### Context

`jobProcessor` runs a full LangGraph `StateGraph` inside a Lambda invocation. LangGraph supports optional checkpointing so that a crashed run can resume from its last completed node rather than starting over.

### Challenge

Lambda functions are stateless and ephemeral. The default in-memory checkpointer is destroyed when the invocation ends, making it useless for cross-invocation resume. A naive Upstash Redis checkpointer instantiated at module scope re-creates a client on every cold start and leaves TCP connections open after the handler returns — causing Lambda to bill for idle time and occasionally hang on teardown.

### Solution

The Redis checkpointer client is initialised lazily inside the graph factory function, not at module scope. The connection is explicitly closed in a `finally` block after the graph run completes. Checkpointing is keyed by `jobId` so that Inngest retries land on the same checkpoint namespace and skip already-completed nodes.

## 2. Bedrock Nova Micro Invocation vs. Direct SDK Models

### Context

The Router Agent classifies which modalities are present using Nova Micro on AWS Bedrock. All other model calls (Document, Vision, Audio, Synthesis, Auditor) go through the Anthropic SDK or OpenAI SDK directly — not Bedrock.

### Challenge

Bedrock's `InvokeModel` API expects a request body shaped to the specific model's contract — Nova Micro uses a `messages` array under a top-level `inferenceConfig` wrapper that differs from the Anthropic Messages API shape. Using the Anthropic SDK client directly against a Bedrock endpoint throws a signing error because the SDK generates its own `Authorization` header that conflicts with AWS SigV4.

### Solution

All Nova Micro calls go through `@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime` using `InvokeModelCommand`. The request body is serialised as JSON and passed as `Uint8Array`. The response body is deserialised and the content string extracted before being passed to the rest of the graph.

The Bedrock scope is intentionally limited to Nova Micro. If a future node requires a Bedrock-hosted Claude model, that decision must be explicit — not the default path.

## 3. Inngest Event Deduplication — S3 Trigger + Frontend Trigger

### Context

The upload pipeline fires an Inngest event from two places: `POST /api/upload` (frontend, immediately after the job record is created) and `ingestHandler` (Lambda, on S3 `ObjectCreated`). This is intentional — the S3 trigger is a safety net in case the frontend call fails mid-flight.

### Challenge

If both succeed, `jobProcessor` runs twice for the same job. The second run overwrites the `confidence_scores` and `governance_trace` in Supabase with a second (different) LLM response — producing non-deterministic results and doubling Lambda + LLM cost.

### Solution

Inngest event deduplication via `idempotencyKey`: both triggers send the event with `id: jobId`. Inngest deduplicates on that key within a 24-hour window — the second event is dropped silently. The frontend trigger is always first; the S3 trigger fires only if the frontend trigger never arrived.

## 4. Upstash Vector Session Isolation

### Context

The Document Agent vectorises chunked PDF content using `text-embedding-3-small` and retrieves relevant chunks via RAG during synthesis. Upstash Vector is a shared index — all jobs write to the same namespace by default.

### Challenge

Without isolation, a retrieval query for Job A can return chunks from Job B if the cosine similarity is high enough. For a security analyst processing a confidential PDF, cross-job bleed is both a correctness failure and a data-handling concern.

### Solution

Every upsert and query call is scoped to a `{jobId}/{userId}/` namespace prefix. Upstash Vector supports arbitrary string prefixes on vector IDs — the prefix is prepended on write and used as a filter on read. On job completion, all vectors under `{jobId}/{userId}/` are deleted to avoid unbounded storage growth.

## 5. Health Probe — Supabase REST vs. SDK Client

### Context

`GET /api/health` probes both Supabase and Upstash Redis to verify runtime dependencies before returning a status response. This endpoint is hit by `scripts/verify-ready.mjs` and UptimeRobot.

### Challenge

Instantiating the Supabase JS SDK client inside the health probe to make a simple liveness check is expensive — the SDK initialises a realtime WebSocket connection on construction that is never used and never cleaned up inside a serverless function. It also requires both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and any SDK-level exception surfaces as an unhandled rejection rather than a clean probe result.

### Solution

The Supabase probe uses a raw `fetch()` to `${url}/rest/v1/` with the `apikey` header set to the anon key. A 200 response indicates the Supabase REST layer is alive. No SDK, no WebSocket, no client state. The Redis probe uses Upstash's REST API at `/ping` — returns `{ result: "PONG" }` on success. Both probes are wrapped in a 4-second `AbortSignal.timeout` to prevent the health handler from hanging.

## 6. Lambda Concurrency = 1 on jobProcessor

### Context

`jobProcessor` invokes Bedrock (Nova Micro), Anthropic SDK (Claude Sonnet ×2), and OpenAI SDK (GPT-4o ×2, Whisper ×1) per job. At portfolio-demo scale, the real cost risk is runaway parallelism, not throughput.

### Challenge

Without a concurrency limit, a burst of upload requests (e.g. a recruiter sharing the demo link) could spin up 20+ simultaneous Lambda executions, each making 6 LLM API calls. The CloudWatch $15/month billing alarm is the last line of defence — not a first-line cost guard.

### Solution

`jobProcessor` is deployed with `reservedConcurrentExecutions: 1` via CDK. A second invocation while the first is running returns a Lambda throttle error; Inngest treats this as a retriable failure and retries with exponential backoff. The user sees a slightly delayed result rather than a cost spike.

This is a deliberate portfolio-scale decision. Production would set concurrency to match the paid tier budget, not hard-cap at 1.

## 7. PII Redaction Before Vectorisation

### Context

The Document Agent chunks and vectorises PDF content. Upstash Vector stores embeddings with their source text as metadata. If the PDF contains names, email addresses, or identification numbers, that text would be stored verbatim in the vector index.

### Challenge

Redaction must happen before `upsert()` — not after. Post-hoc deletion from a vector index is unreliable because embeddings already carry semantic signal about the original text, and there is no guarantee all fragments are found and removed.

### Solution

PII patterns (email, phone, SSN, credit card, full name heuristics) are stripped from each chunk using regex substitution in `documentNode` before the embedding call. The redacted text is what gets embedded and stored as metadata. The unredacted text is never written to Upstash. The synthesis report is generated from the redacted chunks — the auditor scores the redacted synthesis, not the original.

## Update Rules

Update this document when a technical challenge is diagnosed and resolved that:

- Required non-obvious investigation (not just fixing a typo or wrong variable)
- Involved a library or AWS service behaving differently than documented
- Required a structural workaround (lazy init, batching, capping, namespace isolation) rather than a simple fix
- Would be confusing to a future reader without context

If a code change resolves one of these challenges differently, update the relevant entry rather than appending a new one.
